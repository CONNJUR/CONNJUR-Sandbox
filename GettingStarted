1) First, go to your checkout directory (the root) 

doolittle-5:bioclojure Jpeerindex$ ls
README      lib         resources   test
classes     project.clj src

2) Now run "lein deps".  This will go get the apache StringUtils.


3) Now, start repl 

doolittle-5:bioclojure Jpeerindex$ lein repl


REPL started; server listening on localhost port 28701

4) Now, load up the core.clj script 

user=> (load-file "src/BioClojure/core.clj")
#'SeqMine2.core/hasSubstring

5) Yay, it saw the file !  Now, switch to the namespace that has the
methods in it for the core.clj.  There are really only two methods.

user=> (in-ns 'SeqMine2.core)
#<Namespace SeqMine2.core>

6) Okay, now try to see if you can capitalize this string.  just 
call the makeCap method : 

SeqMine2.core=> (makeCap "s1")
"S1"

SeqMine2.core=> 


7) Your done !  Now edit the file to support some real operations.
When you are done, just type 

git add core.clj
git commit
git push 

And that will do it.  

By the way, if you like syntax highlighting, make sure and get this installedthttp://kuriqoo.blogspot.com/2011/02/using-clojure-in-vim.html
