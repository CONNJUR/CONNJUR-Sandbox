1) First, go to your checkout directory (the root) 

doolittle-5:bioclojure Jpeerindex$ ls
README      lib         resources   test
classes     project.clj src


2) Now, start repl 

doolittle-5:bioclojure Jpeerindex$ lein repl


REPL started; server listening on localhost port 28701

3) Now, load up the core.clj script 

user=> (load-file "src/BioClojure/core.clj")
#'SeqMine2.core/hasSubstring

4) Yay, it saw the file !  Now, switch to the namespace that has the
methods in it for the core.clj.  There are really only two methods.

user=> (in-ns 'SeqMine2.core)
#<Namespace SeqMine2.core>

5) Okay, now try to see if you can capitalize this string.  just 
call the makeCap method : 

SeqMine2.core=> (makeCap "s1")
"S1"

SeqMine2.core=> 


6) Your done !  Now edit the file to support some real operations.
When you are done, just type 

git add core.clj
git commit
git push 

And that will do it.
