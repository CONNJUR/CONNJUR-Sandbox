Major:
	write function make-double-bar-chart
		input:
			Map key pair
			x-label
			y-label1, y-label2
	generalize make-double-bar-chart
		want to display many bars for each key
		input
			Map key list
			x-label
			y-labels
	figure out how values are grouped when using histograms
		incanter seems to have some default grouping methodology

Minor:
	fix zoom options (could only zoom in one dimension)
	colors -- especially for double/multi bar-charts
	because the incanter stuff is macros
		they can capture the names in the source code
		and then these names show up in the charts as chart titles
		how can we stop/override/control this?
