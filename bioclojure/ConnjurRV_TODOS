in no particular order:
	decide on an algorithm to color the atoms on the structure in a better way (than just using the blue channel)
	implement that algorithm
	unit-testing
	build a working application (i.e. we have the code, we just need to compile it into an executable)
	determine future goals relaxation-wise and shiftx-wise
	come up with new ways for plotting nmr data, i.e. pearson correlations for chemical shift assignments
	see Icanter_TODOS for incanter goals
