Formatter:

  varian
    number of lines equal to number of points
    minimum indices of 0 in each dimension
    each line unique

  bruker
    number of lines equal to number of dimensions times number of unique grid points
    minimum indices of 1 in each dimension

  toolkit
    number of lines equal to number of unique grid points
    minimum indices of 1 in each dimension

  custom
    number of lines equal to number of points
    minimum indices of 1 in each dimension
    
  json
    number of points equal to number of points in schedule??

  separateTransients
    number of lines equal to sum of all transients
    minimum indices of 1 in each dimension

-------------------------------------------------------

Selector:

  selectNBest
    no elements in output that were not in input
    correct number selected, unless fewer than n in input
    no duplicates

  selectNRandomly
    no elements in output that were not in input
    correct number selected, unless fewer than n in input
    no duplicates

  selectNProb
    no elements in output that were not in input
    correct number selected

  genericSelect
    transients added correctly (where applicable -- if selected multiple times)
    ????indication of error or problem when something goes wrong????
    ??

  for all groupers
    ungrouper (grouper pts) = pts
    grouper (ungrouper pts) = pts  -- ?? is this necessary?
    the set of grid points in ungrouped is:
      equal to the set of grid points in the grouped points

  sepTransSepQuad
    number of points equal to sum of all transients

  combTransCombQuad
    number of (things) equal to number of unique grid points

  combTransSepQuad
    number of (things) equal to number of (pairs) in schedule


-------------------------------------------------------

Quadrature:

  allQuadUnits
    length of output equal to (2 ** (num dims) * length input)
    quadunit have same length as gridpoints
    all input present in output (as part of a tuple)

  justReals
    length of output equal to length of input
    just reals!
    quadunit have same length as gridpoints
    all input present in output (as part of a tuple)

  singleRandom
    length of output equal to length of input
    quadunit have same length as gridpoints
    pretty random distribution
    all input present in output (as part of a tuple)

  allquadunits
    number of quadunits equal to 2 ** (number of dimensions)
    no repeated quadunits
    length of each quadunit equal to number of dimensions


-------------------------------------------------------

Model:

can't combine schedules of different dimensionalities
can't add point to schedule of different dimensionality
GridPoint and QuadUnit have same dimensionality


-------------------------------------------------------

GridPoint:

  uniformGrid
    correct number
    no duplicates
    nothing outside of boundaries
    dimensionality correct

  allLowerBounds
    correct number
    no duplicates
    all on edge
    dimensionality correct

  firstPoint
    1 point
    right position
    dimensionality correct

  lastPoint
    1 point
    right position
    dimensionality correct
