getting set up:

download and install the Haskell Platform

if it installed correctly, you should be able to type 'ghci' from a command terminal

this starts a haskell interpreter

if you started it in the same directory as a source file,
	you can do ':load <filename>' to bring it into the interpreter
	then you can play with the functions it defines
	but everything has to compile -- if there are compile errors, it won't work
