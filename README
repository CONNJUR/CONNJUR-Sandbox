RudolF was a reindeer with a very special asset, his red nose, which glowed very brightly in the night.  For many years, his nose was considered by many to be a hindrance - and his unconventional methodologies were a source of ostrification.  In the age of multicore however, with application logic becoming more and more of an entanglement, RudolF's awkward syntax and stateless logic became an asset, rather than a barrier, to entry.  RudolF currently spans the Clojure and Haskell languages - it's a friendly learning place for anyone interested in LISPs or other functional languages, where we aim to rapidly increase our productivity and understanding of stateless, modular code in an attempt to produce more robust, less buggy systems.  In particular, we aim to focus on both tutorial code and implementations of novel text mining and bioinformatics algorithms on the RudolF.
