BioClojure is now online ! 

To deploy : 

1) Checkout and set up the project, (see the README).
2) Make sure you have RubyGems installed, so you can run the $>gem install commands....
3) Create a heroku account if you don't already have one.  
4) Follow these directions 
   https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/clojure
   (Ignore the parts regarding the Procfile and the web.clj file, since we already 
   have those in Bioclojure's source file.
5) Finally, when you run the command to "push" to the heroku repository, 
     sudo git push heroku master
     heroku ps:scale web=1
